*FEND-P09
**Feed Reader Testing

The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to use JS testing tools, such as Jasmine (in this case)
to implement T.D.D (Test Driven Development) or to have a library of test suites which can be used
as validation of your source code before each build.

To run this project:

1. Download or Fork this repository.
2. Open "index.html" in a modern browser.
3. Watch the tests flash by, the main application paints and then scroll down to see the results of the test suites.

Note: If you are interested to see what tests where used and how they were coded, all test suites for this project
can be found in "jasmine/spec/feedreader.js".
