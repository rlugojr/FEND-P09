##FEND-P09
###Feed Reader Testing
========

The purpose of this project is to learn and apply JS testing tools, such as Jasmine (in this case), to implement T.D.D (Test Driven Development) or to have a library of test suites which can be used
as validation of your source code before each build.

_This repository contains my version of the solution to complete Udacity's Front End Web Developer's Project #09._


###Features
--------

- Sample application provided by the awesome team at Udacity.
- Examples of Jasmine test suites, created to test the sample application.


###Using this Project
------------

To run this project:

```
1. Download or Fork this repository.
2. Open "index.html" in a modern browser.
3. Watch the tests flash by, the main application paints and then scroll down to see the results of the test suites.

Alternatively, you can view a running instance of my [version](https://rlugojr.github.io/FEND-P09/), hosted on GitHub Pages.
